# LeagueOfLegendsGamePredictor

This project utilizes Riot's API to gather game data in order to train a feed-forward neural network to predict the result of a given game using only pre-game knowledge, such as what champions are selected, and the selected champions' statistics such as win rate, and performance.

The detail of the approach and the model is explained in [League of Legends Game Predictor Based on Champion Select.pdf](https://github.com/Jacob-Yage-Jin/LeagueOfLegendsGamePredictor/blob/main/League%20of%20Legends%20Game%20Predictor%20Based%20on%20Champion%20Select.pdf)

The best performing model has an accuracy of 55.62%
